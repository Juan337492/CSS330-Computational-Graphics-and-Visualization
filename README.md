3D Workspace Simulation :  3D-rendered scene with dynamic lighting, textured objects, and interactive camera controls. Built with OpenGL for a computational graphics course.

<h2>3D Workspace Simulation</h2>

This project showcases a 3D-rendered scene with dynamic lighting, textured objects, and interactive camera controls. Developed using OpenGL, the project reflects a comprehensive approach to software design and development in computational graphics.

<h2>How I Approach Designing Software</h2>

Working on this project has enhanced my design skills, particularly in modular programming and creating reusable functions. Designing the 3D scene required careful planning of materials, textures, and lighting to ensure a cohesive and visually appealing environment. My design process involved breaking the project into smaller tasks, starting with object selection and material definitions, followed by lighting setup and interactive camera controls.
This iterative approach ensured that each component was refined and integrated smoothly. These tactics, such as modular design and iterative refinement, will be invaluable in future projects, allowing me to tackle complex problems systematically.

<h2>How I Approach Developing Programs</h2>

Developing this 3D scene introduced me to new strategies, such as leveraging shaders for advanced visual effects and managing textures for realistic rendering. Iteration played a significant role—each milestone built upon the previous one, allowing me to test, refine, and expand functionality incrementally.

Through this project, my coding practices have evolved to prioritize clarity, reusability, and organization. By the end, I could seamlessly integrate navigation controls, material definitions, and camera adjustments, reflecting a polished final product.

<h2>How Computer Science Helps Me Reach My Goals</h2>

Exploring computational graphics has provided me with valuable skills in 3D modeling, lighting, and rendering—knowledge that extends beyond this project. These skills are applicable to future coursework and professional opportunities, such as game development, simulation, and visualization.

Additionally, the project has reinforced my understanding of how to create engaging user experiences. This knowledge will support my aspirations in software engineering, where crafting intuitive and visually appealing applications is essential.
